## Why?
Once upon a time there was a UniZar Moodle 2 webpage. Such webpage had an harmonious blue & white color scheme, all was cool, student and techer's retinas where healthy. Until one day... A Machiavellian web developer decided to change this light blue for a bright and striking orange at some random places. What a prick! But fear no more mate, FixThatOrangeThing Chrome Extension is here to save you all!
